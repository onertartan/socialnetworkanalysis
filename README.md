Social Networks Analysis
A capstone project for UCSD MOOC. Basic graders, scc and social media test files were provided by UCSD team.  Briefly project focuses on:
1-Findind EGOnets for a given center node.
2-Finding strongly connected components in directional graphs.
3- For a given user v and for given a number n,  bringing n new friend suggestions for the given user according to the number of common friends. For example, first suggestion should have the most common friends with the user, and the others should follow in descending order in terms of number of common friends. If n suggestions cannot be found, all possible suggestions should be shown. Results should be shown with the number of common friends for each suggestion.  
4-Dividing a community into sub-communities. For a given community and a given number n, divide the community into sub-communities. A directionally connected network is considered (like Facebook friendship). If all network is connected, it should be divided into n sub-communities. If there are several unconnected sub-networks, each one represents a sub-community. If the number of unconnected sub-networks is less than n, starting from the biggest; sub-networks should be divided to obtain n communities.
